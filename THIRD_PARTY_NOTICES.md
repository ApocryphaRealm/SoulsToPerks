## SKSE Menu Framework consumer header (`include/SKSEMenuFramework.h`)

From https://github.com/QTR-Modding/SKSE-Menu-Framework-3, copied 2026-08-24 while that repository was LGPL-2.1
(it became GPL-3.0 on 2026-08-29); modified here to prefer the Apocrypha Menu Framework. LGPL-2.1 permits its use in
this GPL-3.0-or-later work.

## DevBench consumer API (`include/DevBench/`, `source/DevBench/`)

MIT - the notice is `include/DevBench/DevBenchAPI.LICENSE.txt`, kept with the files.

## Notes carried from the previous licence file

Third-party components, each under its own permissive licence:

* Dear ImGui (MIT) - https://github.com/ocornut/imgui
* CommonLibSSE-NG (MIT) - https://github.com/CharmedBaryon/CommonLibSSE-NG
* DevBenchAPI header/source (MIT) - the consumer API of DevBench, vendored so the framework can
  register its DevBench driving tools; devbench.dll itself is a separate, optional, GPL program
  that this framework only talks to over its REST API.

Compatibility note: Apocrypha Menu Framework exports an API compatible with the PUBLIC consumer
header of SKSE Menu Framework so that mods written against that header can register with it. It
is an original implementation and contains no code from SKSE Menu Framework.
